# About the project

Bun is a simple jumping game developed in C++ with the SFML library. 
It was a way for me to practice C++ development (which I am new to) and learn to produce clean and documented code.

# How to install?
You simply need to clone or download this repository, and run the `bun.exe` file. 
If you are using an IDE, you can also run the `main` function from there.

:warning: Make sure not to move the files around, otherwise the `bun.exe` file 
might not be able to find the `asset` folder that contains necessary sprites and text fonts.
